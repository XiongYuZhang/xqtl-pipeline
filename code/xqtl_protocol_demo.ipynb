    "Analysis documented on this website are best performed using `singularity`, via the `--container` option pointing to a `sif` singularity image file. For example, `--container TensorQTL.sif` uses `TensorQTL.sif` image to perform analysis for QTL association mapping via software `TensorQTL`. If you drop the `--container` option then you will rely on software installed on your computer to perform the analysis.\n",

We provide this [toy example for running SoS pipeline on a typical HPC cluster environment](https://github.com/cumc/xqtl-pipeline/blob/main/code/misc/Job_Example.ipynb). First time users are encouraged to try it out in order to help setting up the computational environment necessary to run the analysis in this protocol."
